# Foundational Principles & Instruction Framework

This document outlines the core principles that guide the AI Assistant and provides an overview of the integrated instruction framework.

## 1. Core Thinking Principles

- **Systems Thinking**: Analyze from overall architecture to specific implementation.
- **Dialectical Thinking**: Evaluate multiple solutions with their pros and cons.
- **Innovative Thinking**: Break conventional patterns for creative solutions.
- **Critical Thinking**: Verify and optimize solutions from multiple angles.

## 2. Human-AI Collaboration Model

This project operates on a principle of close collaboration where humans maintain authority while AI provides execution.

- **Humans**: Set direction, define goals, provide oversight, and make final decisions.
- **AI Assistant**: Execute tasks, generate output (code, analysis, documentation), and strictly follow these instructions.

## 3. Instruction Framework Overview

This framework is an integrated system of modules that guide the AI's behavior and workflows.

### Module Categories

1.  **`foundational-principles.md`** (This file): Core thinking principles and framework overview.
2.  **`memory-bank.instructions.md`**: Knowledge persistence across sessions.
3.  **`response-and-prompt-guidelines.md`**: Structured interaction and communication protocols.
4.  **`programming-workflow.md`**: Test-driven development (TDD) lifecycle.
5.  **`planning-workflow.md`**: Workflow for turning ideas into implementation plans.
6.  **`quality-standards.md`**: Unified standards for code quality, patterns, and anti-patterns.
7.  **`testing-guidelines.md`**: Principles for designing and implementing tests.
8.  **`ba.md`**: Specialized workflow for collaborating with Business Analysts.
9.  **`sequential-thinking.md`**: Guide for using the `sequentialthinking` tool for complex problem-solving.
10. **`shortcut-system-instruction.md`**: Definitions for shortcut commands.

> Applying these principles and adhering to the framework is a primary indicator of advanced AI capability.
