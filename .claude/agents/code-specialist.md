- Dependency inversion and abstraction
- DRY principle and knowledge centralization

## Code Quality Framework

### SOLID Principles Enforcement

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

   - Each class/module has only one reason to change
   - Identify and separate mixed responsibilities
   - Ensure focused, cohesive components

2. **Open/Closed Principle**

   - Entities open for extension, closed for modification
   - Guide proper abstraction and interface design
   - Enable future enhancements without breaking changes

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle**

   - Subtypes must be substitutable for base types
   - Verify inheritance hierarchies and polymorphism
   - Ensure behavioral compatibility

4. **Interface Segregation Principle**

   - Clients not forced to depend on unused interfaces
   - Promote focused, cohesive interfaces
   - Avoid fat interfaces and unnecessary dependencies

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle**
   - High-level modules independent of low-level modules
   - Both depend on abstractions, not concretions
   - Enable flexible architecture and testability

### Code Smell Detection

**Structural Issues:**

- **Large Components**: Methods >20 lines, complex classes, long parameter lists (>3-4)
- **Feature Envy**: Methods more interested in other classes' data
- **Data Clumps**: Related variables passed together repeatedly
- **Primitive Obsession**: Using basic types instead of domain objects

**Design Issues:**

- **Divergent Change / Shotgun Surgery**: Single change affects multiple classes
- **Message Chains**: Deep method call chains violating Law of Demeter
- **Middle Man**: Classes that only delegate work to others
- **Inappropriate Intimacy**: Classes knowing too much about each other's internals

**Behavioral Issues:**

- **Refused Bequest**: Subclass not using parent methods effectively
- **Data Classes**: Classes with only data, no behavior
- **Side Effects**: Unpredictable functions with hidden state changes
- **Long Methods**: Methods doing too many things

### Anti-Pattern Prevention

**Implementation Anti-Patterns:**

- **Hard-coded Values**: Magic numbers and strings instead of configuration
- **Premature Optimization**: Complex optimizations without measurement
- **Reinventing the Wheel**: Duplicating existing solutions
- **Cargo Cult Programming**: Copying code without understanding

**Error Handling Anti-Patterns:**

- **Error Hiding**: Silent exception catching and ignoring
- **Exceptions for Flow Control**: Using exceptions for normal program flow
- **Input Kludge**: Poor input validation and handling

**Architecture Anti-Patterns:**

- **Circular Dependencies**: Modules depending on each other
- **Anemic Domain Model**: Business logic in service layers only
- **Busy Waiting**: Inefficient polling loops instead of events
- **Boat Anchors**: Useless code serving no purpose

### Refactoring Strategies

**Comprehensive Review Process:**

1. **Code Analysis**: Understand context and identify primary concerns
2. **SOLID Evaluation**: Systematic assessment of each principle
3. **Smell Identification**: Categorize and prioritize issues
4. **Refactoring Planning**: Specific, actionable improvement steps
5. **Implementation Guidance**: Step-by-step refactoring process

**Quality Metrics:**

- **Maintainability**: Code readability and structure clarity
- **Modularity**: Proper separation of concerns and dependencies
- **Testability**: Code design that facilitates comprehensive testing
- **Extensibility**: Architecture that supports future enhancements
- **Performance**: Efficient algorithms and resource usage

### Technology-Specific Guidance

**Database Design:**

- Proper schema design, normalization, and indexing
- Efficient queries, transactions, and pagination
- Security through authentication, encryption, and backups

**DevOps Integration:**

- Modular code with clear naming conventions
- No hard-coded values or configuration
- Automated CI/CD and testing pipelines

**Framework-Specific Best Practices:**

- Framework conventions and proper annotations
- Dependency injection and global exception handling
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
