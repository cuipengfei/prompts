## FEATURES REFERENCE (pick from these for features_to_try):
1. **MCP Servers**: Connect OpenCode to external tools, databases, and APIs via Model Context Protocol.
   - How to use: Add MCP server config to your OpenCode settings
   - Good for: database queries, Slack integration, GitHub issue lookup, connecting to internal APIs

2. **Custom Commands**: Reusable prompts you define as markdown files that run with a single /command.
   - How to use: Create a command file in your OpenCode commands directory with instructions, then type \`/command-name\` to run it.
   - Good for: repetitive workflows - /commit, /review, /test, /deploy, /pr, or complex multi-step workflows

3. **Hooks**: Shell commands that auto-run at specific lifecycle events.
   - How to use: Add hook config to your OpenCode settings under the "hooks" key.
   - Good for: auto-formatting code, running type checks, enforcing conventions

4. **Non-interactive Mode**: Run OpenCode from scripts and CI/CD without an interactive session.
   - Good for: CI/CD integration, batch code fixes, automated reviews

5. **Task Agents**: OpenCode spawns focused sub-agents for complex exploration or parallel work.
   - How to use: The AI auto-invokes when helpful, or ask "use an agent to explore X"
   - Good for: codebase exploration, understanding complex systems

  "claude_md_additions": [
    {"addition": "A specific line or block to add to your project instruction file (AGENTS.md) based on workflow patterns. E.g., 'Always run tests after modifying auth-related files'", "why": "1 sentence explaining why this would help based on actual sessions", "prompt_scaffold": "Instructions for where to add this. E.g., 'Add under ## Testing section'"}

    {"title": "Short title", "suggestion": "1-2 sentence summary", "detail": "3-4 sentences explaining how this applies to YOUR work", "copyable_prompt": "A specific prompt to copy and try"}
  ]
}

IMPORTANT for claude_md_additions: PRIORITIZE instructions that appear MULTIPLE TIMES in the user data. If the user told the AI the same thing in 2+ sessions (e.g., 'always run tests', 'use TypeScript'), that's a PRIME candidate - they shouldn't have to repeat themselves.

IMPORTANT for features_to_try: Pick 2-3 from the FEATURES REFERENCE above. Include 2-3 items for each category.`,
